# UTKala - Final Project for Advanced Programming Course

This repository contains the final project completed as part of the Advanced Programming (AP) Course at UT-CE in Fall 2022. The project is a simulation of an online shopping platform, similar to Amazon or Digikala, with functionalities implemented across two phases. The first phase features a terminal-based interface with advanced features like comments, ratings, and discounts, while the second phase introduces a basic HTML frontend enhanced with CSS stylings.
